This is an incomplete remake of one of my antiquated C++ projects.

The following remains to be done:
	- Preventing ProcessShredder from attempting to terminate/freeze itself when selected, and rather have it exit gracefully after terminating/freezing the other selections.
	- Fetching the username processes belong too.
	- Sorting based on column clicks.
	- Identifying processes under windows’ DRM protection (protected s.t. only transient kernel hacks enable hooking).
	- Politely calling for processes under windows’ DRM protection to close.
